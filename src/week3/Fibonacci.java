/*
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (called a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1.
 Therefore, the Fibonacci sequence begins as follows:
 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,â€¦
 Create a method that will give you Nth Fibonacci number;Fibonacci number reads like index number,start with 0
 EX:
 n=0  0th fibonacci number is  0
 n=1 first fibonacci number is 1
 n=3  third fibonacci number is 2
 n=8 ....                      21
