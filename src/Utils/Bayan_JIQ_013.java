    How can you access the last element in an array?

    Indexes start at 0 (zero).

    First: know how to check the number of elements: arr.length

    Second: know how to read the last index (regardless of number of elements): length - 1

    Third: put them together: arr[arr.length-1] --> will help you read the last index
